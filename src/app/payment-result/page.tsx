/**
 * Lands here after SSLCommerz checkout redirects the customer's browser
 * back (via payments-browser-redirect on the backend, see payments/views.py).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the `status` query param here is purely informational, for
 * a friendly message — it is NOT proof a payment succeeded. The only
 * thing that actually confirms a payment is the server-to-server IPN
 * webhook, which SSLCommerz calls independently and which always
 * re-validates against SSLCommerz's own validation API. So even on
 * status=success we deliberately don't claim the booking is confirmed —
 * we tell the customer to expect confirmation shortly, which is both
 * accurate and matches how the backend actually works.
